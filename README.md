Description: 
A responsive portfolio website using CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap. The website has 3 HTML pages: About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Page. I will use this responsive portfolio to update potential employers on the projects I am working on and to showcase my skills. I utilize responsive images, psuedo-elements, forms, and media queries to create a responsive website.
